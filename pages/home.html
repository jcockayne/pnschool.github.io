    <p>
      The second edition of Probabilistic Numerics Spring School and Research Workshop will take place in Southampton
      from
      8th to 10th of
      April, 2024.
    </p>

    <p>

      The <b>school</b> consists of two days of (in-person) lectures, keynotes, and tutorial
      sessions, on the 8th and 9th of April.
      It will be held in English, and is aimed at graduate students, researchers, and professionals interested in
      probabilistic numerical methods. Prior experience with probabilistic numerical methods is not a prerequisite.
      The school features <!--<a href="school.html">-->lectures and keynotes<!--</a>--> by leading experts, and hands-on code
      tutorials.
      This makes the school an opportunity to quickly get up to speed with these methods, including concrete practical
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The school will be followed by a <b>workshop</b> on the 10th of April, 2024.
      The workshop offers a stage for advances in the probabilistic computation, by <!--<a
        href="workshop.html">-->researchers<!--</a>--> working in the field.
      Both events (school and workshop) will be held in conjunction. There is no need to register for either of them
      separately, and participants are invited to participate in both parts.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      <b>Q: Am I interested in probabilistic numerical methods?</b>
      <br>
      <i>
        A: You might be interested in probabilistic numerics if you are also keen to (learn about) topics such as:
        numerical analysis and scientific computing, uncertainty quantification, Bayesian inference, machine learning,
        Gaussian processes, or probabilistic
        programming. In particular, you may also be interested if you are a scientist working with simulation methods,
        or a machine learning researcher interested in scientific applications of AI, or in large-scale Bayesian
        inference.
        Find out more about probabilistic numerics <a href="https://probabilistic-numerics.org/"
          target="_blank">here</a>, on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_numerics" target="_blank">
          Wikipedia</a>, or in the 
        <a href="https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/textbooks/" target="_blank">
          book about the topic</a>.
      </i>
    </p>


    <p>
      <b>Q: What are the prerequisites?</b>
      <br>
      <i>
        A: You should be able to follow the tutorials with basic knowledge in linear algebra, probability theory, and
        numerical analysis. If you are interested, but feel you do not have the required background yet, take a
        look at Chapter I ("Mathematical Background") in the <a href="https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/textbooks/"
          target="_blank">probabilistic numerics book</a>.
        The tutorials will involve programming exercises, largely in the python-based ML stack.

      The dinner will take place on Tuesday evening (18:30) at <a href="https://freistil.beer/" target="_blank">Brauwerk Freistil T&uuml;bingen</a>.
    </p>


    <h2>Practical sessions </h2>

    The ProbNum Spring School includes practical sessions in which we implement some probabilistic numerical algorithms (in Python). 
    You can find all instructions for the practical sessions <a href="https://github.com/probabilistic-numerics/probnum-spring-school">here</a>.
    Please have a careful look at the instructions and make sure that you have everything set up and ready to go before the first session on Monday afternoon (for example, that you have successfully installed all dependencies). 


    <h2> Food, drinks and activities in T&uuml;bingen </h2>
    
    <p>
    If you are wondering what to do on Monday evening: PhD students from Philipp Hennig's group have kindly compiled a list of suggestions for where to get food and/or drinks in T&uuml;bingen.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find the recommendations <a href="../files/suggestions.pdf" target=_blank>here</a>.

            Philipp holds the Chair for the Methods of Machine Learning at the University of T&uuml;bingen.
            He studied Physics in Heidelberg, Germany and at Imperial College, London, before moving to the University
            of Cambridge, UK, where he attained a PhD in the group of Sir David JC MacKay with research on machine
            learning.
            Since this time, he is interested in connections between computation and inference. With international
            collaborators, he helped establish the field of probabilistic numerics.
            In 2022, Cambridge University Press published his textbook on the subject,
            <a href="https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/textbooks/" target="_blank">Probabilistic Numerics —
              Computation as Machine
              Learning</a>.

            Nicholas is an incoming Postdoc at Denmark's Technical University. He has been a PhD student at the
            University
            of T&uuml;bingen since September 2019.
            Prior to this, he was a student research assistant at the Institute for Numerical Simulation at the
            University of Bonn. He holds an MSc
            in
            Mathematics
            from the University of Bonn and a BSc in Mathematics in Business and Economics from the
            University of
            Mannheim.
            His research interests lie in probabilistic numerics, differential equations, and
            physics-informed machine
            learning.
